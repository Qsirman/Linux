# Vim's installation and configuration

## What is vim?
* I am sure who once used Unix or Linux must have used a editor named vi.
* And Vim is just a totally new version of vi,which keeps all of vi's function and most style and make more convinient for users.

## Installation
* **[ubuntu]** sudo apt-get install vim
	* vim has a lot of versions and you can just command `vim` when you haven't install vim if you want to see all of the versions of vim.

## Configuration
* We change vim's configuration by editing `/etc/vim/vimrc`.
	* **[ubuntu]** sudo /etc/vim/vimrc
		* **[warning]** you must open `vimrc` with `sudo` so that you can save changes.
